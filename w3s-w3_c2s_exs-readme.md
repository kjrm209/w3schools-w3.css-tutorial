Writer's Note:-

(1.) The rounded curves of the photograph display indicate that this particular design feature is useful for illustrating the integration of this said element within a skeleton plane with a landscape orientation
(1a.) The graphical pattern of the photograph's border is "curved line - to straight line - to curved line". This feature indicates that the mathematical gradient of those borders changes at the points of reference where the vector is changed from a ninety-degree-angle to a forty-five-degree angle at the graphics-depicted curvatures of the photograph's borders.
